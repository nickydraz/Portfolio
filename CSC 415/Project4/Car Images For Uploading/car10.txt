The Emperor said I couldn’t have my Earth car anymore. He said Earth doesn’t exist yet, so it’s against the laws of science for me to have it. But I’m the chosen one! I do what I want! I’m selling this bad boy on my website, Darth Vader’s Weapon Emporium. Don’t worry about the fact that it’s a weapons store, this is a special deal. Once in a lifetime. Do not disappoint me, admiral.
